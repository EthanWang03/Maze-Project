# Maze-Project
maze solving algorithm using DFS, BFS and A*

Implimentation: https://ethanwang03.pythonanywhere.com/

Uses DFS algorithm to generate a maze ranging from a length and width of 25 to 55

There is also an option to generate a solution to the maze
The user has the choice to solve the maze using DFS, BFS or A* algorithm
It also returns the number of cells visited before the solution is found as well as the length of the solution path and the execution time

There is also an option to show the steps that the algorithm uses to find the solution to the maze using an animation
The lighter blue paths show visited pathways and the dark blue paths show the solution path that the algorithm found
This helps to visualize the backtracking nature of the DFS algorithm and the systematic exploration of the BFS and A* algorithm
The visualization also helps to show the A* Heuristics pathfinding as it prioritizes cells that are closer to the exit of the maze which improves efficiency for most cases
