maze generating algorithm using DFS

Implimentation: https://ethanwang03.pythonanywhere.com/

Uses DFS algorithm to generate a maze ranging from a length and width of 25 to 75

There is also an option to generate a solution the maze
The solution is generated also using DFS

There is also an option to show the steps that the DFS algorithm uses to find the solution to the maze using an animation
The lighter blue paths show visited pathways and the darkblue paths show the shortest path that the algorithm found
This helps to visualize the back tracking nature of the DFS algorithm
